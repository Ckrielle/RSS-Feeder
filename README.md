## General Info
***RSS***: I could explain it to you, but I'd rather leave the [Unaboomer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMH9w6pyzvU&ab_channel=LukeSmith) himself do the talking.

**Why**: I like RSS feeds, I want more people to adopt them, and I wanted to do a bash script.

## Installation 
Essentially it's just a simple
```
git clone https://github.com/Ckrielle/RSS-Feeder
```
However you won't be able to use the Youtube function fresh out of the box. To use it you will have to generate an API key from the Google Developer Console by creating a new project and adding the key to the script.

## To-Do
There are some things which can be added:
* Obviously the feature to add reddit posts.
* Create combinations in reddit and github.
* Add loops.
* Extend the websites that are offered.
If anyone would like to implement any of these, or has ideas of his/her own feel free to contribute. 
I'd also appreciate it if you could show me more efficient ways as to how the code should work.

## Contact Me

## License
See LICENSE for more info. Tbh I don't even know why I put one but oh welp.
